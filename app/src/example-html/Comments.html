    2652, <em>allo ti</em> is translated as a direct interrogative.

  <p id="c2">
    <span class="tags">#otherPlato</span><br />Socrates will often insist that
    those who really know something also know what it is they know&mdash;and
    that it is better to be ignorant but mindful of one’s ignorance (to “know
    that one knows nothing”) than to know something yet fail to recognize the
    limits of one’s knowledge. See <em>Apology</em> 21b-23b and 29b for an
    expression this view.

  <p id="c3"><span class="tags">#cultural</span><br />That is, Zeus.</p>
  <p id="c4">
    <span class="tags">#otherPlato</span><br />For Socrates, the recognition of
    one’s ignorance is a key step in our learning. A nice illustration of this
    point can be found in the slave lesson presented in the
    <em>Meno</em> (82a-86c; see especially 84a-b).

  <p id="c5">
    <span class="tags">#translation</span><br />The Greek word here is
    <em>dialogoi</em>, from which we get our term for Plato’s “dialogues.”

  <p id="c6">
    <span class="tags">#otherplato #philosophical</span><br />One might wonder
    how well the view suggested here would cohere with Socrates’
    self-presentation in other dialogues. In the <em>Apology</em>, for instance,
    we find a Socrates with strong convictions about what is just and
    unjust&mdash;a Socrates who claims to know that it is unjust to disobey
    one’s moral superior (29b), and who is prepared to risk his life to disobey
    a tyrant’s order he takes to be unjust (32b). Can Socrates profess ignorance
    about matters of justice and nonetheless express and act on convictions of
    this sort?<br />One possible response requires our distinguishing knowledge
    of what makes things just, and explains the justice of any just actions,
    from knowledge of particular instances of justice (obeying your moral
    superior is just, cheating at dice is unjust, and so on). The first kind of
    knowledge  amounts to a kind of expertise about some subject, while the
    second is everyday knowledge (so that you might, for instance, know that
    eating loads of sugar is bad for you, even if you don’t have the expertise
    to fully explain why). Socrates might thus think he is ignorant when it
    comes to this first kind of knowledge, since he is not an expert about
    justice, even while taking himself have the second, everyday kind of
    knowledge. But the distinction doesn’t seem to be on Alcibiades’ radar here.

    <span class="tags">#translation #scholarly</span><br />See Denyer, p.119, on
    the idiomatic use of <em>to de</em>, citing the LSJ entry “<em
      >ho, he, to</em
    >,” A.VIII.3: “τὸ δέ abs., but the fact is.” Denyer suggests “And how, in
    fact, were things?”
  </p>
  <p id="c8">
    <span class="tags">#translation</span><br />The Greek word here is
    <em>logos</em>, with meanings ranging from “speech” or “statement” to
    “account”, “principle” or “reason.” Socrates is not referring literally to a
    full argument here, but rather a single point or move within the argument
    (in this case, the same point made at 109d above).
  </p>
  <p id="c9">
    <span class="tags">#translation</span><br />The Greek phrase is
    <em>ouk... spoudaios</em>, literally “not... serious” though here translated
    as “worthless.” There are questions about what kind of worth this might be,
    especially when it is applied not only to teachers, but also to the things
    they teach. Are some subjects more worth taking seriously than others
    because they are harder? Or because they are worthier in some other way?
    (And, when Alcibiades claims that <em>Greek</em> is worthy, does he have in
    mind the same idea as Socrates does?)
  </p>
  <p id="c10">
    <span class="tags">#otherPlato</span><br />For a similar sentiment, see for
    instance <em>Crito</em> 47a-48b.
  </p>
  <p id="c11">
    <span class="tags">#cultural</span><br />The reference here is to
    <em>petteia</em>, a type of Greek game that typically involved tokens that
    were moved around a board. These are to be contrasted with <em>kubeia</em>,
    games that involve dice. For more information, including pictures of
    archaeological finds, see Ignatiadou, D. ‘Luxury Board Games for the
    Northern Greek Elite.’ Archimède: archéologie et histoire ancienne 6:

    <span class="tags">#translation</span><br /><em>phaulos</em>, often
    translated “trivial,” is here contrasted with <em>spoudaios</em> (see note
    above).
  </p>
  <p id="c13">
    <span class="tags">#philosophical</span><br />How defensible is this
    principle? If to be “worthier” is to be more difficult, the principle might
    seem attractive: if someone can’t teach something less difficult, why think
    they can teach something more difficult? But this version of the
    principle is open to an objection. Someone may be unable to teach something
    less difficult simply because it doesn’t matter enough for them to
    have invested the time in understanding it, and able to teach something more
    difficult because it matters enough to deserve their attention. The very
    examples in the text, board games and justice, support this line of
    objection: we might explain the many’s inability to teach skill at board
    games by pointing to the insignificance of board games, not the cognitive
    deficiencies of the many. A similar objection will arise if we formulate the
    principle in terms of the value of the pursuit: we cannot infer that if
    someone cannot teach something less valuable, they cannot teach something
    more valuable, for the same reasons.

    <span class="tags">#cultural</span><br />The Greek word here,
    <em>hellēnizō</em>, has connotations of learning not only the Greek language
    but also Greek customs and norms. An alternate translation that brings in
    this normative valence would be “I also learned proper Greek from them.”
    (that is, “proper Greek” not as opposed to Greek slang, but rather what the
    Greeks perceived as the proper manners and values that go along with Greek
    culture. Denyer has a helpful, more extended note on this point (pp.121-2).
  </p>
  <p id="c15">
    <span class="tags">#Greektext #scholarly</span><br />Here Burnet prints
    <em>epainoint’</em> (“[they would justly] be praised [for]”), which is found
    in some manuscripts. Denyer (p.122) conjectures <em>epaniois</em> (“you
    would [justly] refer back [to]”), suggesting that it was later corrupted.
    Since there is no manuscript evidence for Denyer’s alternative, we do not
    adopt it here. Talk of praise may not be out of place in context, where the
    goodness and worth of teachers are under examination.
  </p>
  <p id="c16">
    <span class="tags">#translation #philosophical</span><br />Denyer (p.123)
    suggests translating “which things are sticks or stones” (see LSJ IV),
    noting that <em>poion</em> (“what sort” might be used in place of <em
      >ti</em
    >
    “what,” to avoid confusion with the famous Socratic “what is it?” questions,
    which seek a definition. However,<em>poion</em>
    often asks after a thing’s qualities, and so the translation aims to
    preserve this possibility. At the same time, it does not demand it, insofar
    as “what sorts of things” might also be asking for an identification of some
    things and not an account of their qualities.
  </p>
  <p id="c17">
    <span class="tags">#philosophical #otherPlato</span><br />To know what sorts
    of things are sticks and stones is just to know some of the qualities of
    these things (e.g. sticks come from trees, stones can break glass, etc),
    where this is distinct from knowing what the thing is (the definition of the
    thing in question). It might seem possible to know the qualities of certain
    things without knowing the definition of the thing whose qualities one
    knows, especially if the standard for a definition is high (as it is for the
    Socrates Plato presents in his dialogues&mdash;see
    <em>Euthyphro</em> 10a-11b). In the <em>Meno</em>, however, Plato has
    Socrates and his interlocutor agree to an important principle: you cannot
    know what sort of thing something is if you don’t know what the thing is
    (71b). This invites the question later raised by <em>Meno</em> (80d5-7): how
    is learning possible, if one begins without knowing what something is, and
    one can’t even know what sort of thing something is without knowing what it
    is?
  </p>
  <p id="c18">
    <span class="tags">#translation</span><br />Socrates here uses
    <em>manthanō</em> (literally “learn,” here translated more colloquially “get
    a good idea of”) to express his apparently growing comprehension of
    Alcibiades’ suggestion. The same verb is translated elsewhere as “learn.”
  </p>
  <p id="c19">
    <span class="tags">#cultural #otherPlato</span><br />Something that would
    require expertise (in horse breeding or horsemanship), and about which
    Socrates suggests there are in fact experts (see <em>Euthyphro</em> 13a,
    <em>Apology</em> 25b, <em>Meno</em> 93d, <em>Hippias Major</em> 284a, and
    others&mdash;note also <em>Alcibiades</em> 121e, 124e).
  </p>
  <p id="c20">
    <span class="tags">#otherPlato</span><br />It’s not just the many who
    disagree about these things, but the gods, too (see
    <em>Euthyphro</em> 8d-e).
  </p>
  <p id="c21">
    <span class="tags">#cultural</span><br />This one of several terms that
    Homer uses to refer to the Greeks. The <em>Iliad</em> portrays part of the
    action of the famous Trojan War that took place when the Greeks banded
    together to seize the city of Troy.
  </p>
  <p id="c22">
    <span class="tags">#cultural</span><br />The battles mentioned here all took
    place in central Greece among the Greeks themselves. In 457 BCE the
    Athenians were defeated by the Spartans and Boeotians at Tanagra, but then
    the Athenians returned and captured Tanagra a few months later. The battle
    of Coroneia (also spelled Coronea) took place ten years later in 447 and was
    a significant Athenian defeat.
  </p>
  <p id="c23">
    <span class="tags">#philosophical #comparative</span><br />The argument in
    the text distinguishes between cases in which there is no actual
    disagreement between communities (e.g. the rules of the Greek language) and
    cases in which there is actual disagreement between communities (e.g. the
    nature of justice and injustice). But is actual disagreement about topic T
    necessary to make us doubt that the many know about T? We might think that
    the fact that the many present themselves as teachers of (say) justice even
    though they are not good teachers of justice should make us doubt their
    reliability in general, not just when there is disagreement. Or we
    might think something even more radical: that the fact that a source of
    knowledge that we have always trusted&mdash;our immediate
    communities&mdash;turned out to be unreliable should make us worried about
    other previously secure seeming avenues of knowledge.<br />al-Ghazali’s The
    Rescuer from Error, later in the philosophical tradition, takes up this last
    idea. It begins with the observation that what religious tradition we are
    raised in as children determines the religious tradition we adhere to as
    adults; but instead of restricting himself to the problem of disagreements
    in “conformist” beliefs, al-Ghazali uses this as motivation to examine other
    belief-forming mechanisms that he had previously considered secure, like
    perception.
