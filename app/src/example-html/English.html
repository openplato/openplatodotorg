  <p>
    S. Then <span class="hl" id="e1">isn’t it the case</span> that the better I
    was asking about just now&mdash;with respect to making war or not, and with
    whom and when one ought or ought not do so&mdash;is in fact the just? Isn’t
    it?
  </p>
  <p>A. It seems so...</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(109d)</span>
  <p>
    S. How, then, my dear Alcibiades?
    <span class="hl" id="e2">Have you fooled yourself by not knowing this</span
    >, or have you fooled me by taking lessons with and learning from someone
    who taught you to distinguish the just and the unjust? And who is this? Tell
    me too, so that you might introduce me as another pupil for him.
  </p>
  <p>A. You’re mocking me, Socrates.</p>
  <p>
    S. By the <span class="hl" id="e3">god of friendship</span>, mine and
    yours&mdash;he’s the last one I’d mess with&mdash;no! But if you are able,
    tell me who it is.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(109e)</span>
  <p>
    A. And what if I am not able? Do you not think I could know about just and
    unjust things in another way?
  </p>
  <p>S. Yes, if you were to discover them.</p>
  <p>A. But do you not believe that I would discover them?</p>
  <p>S. I do, very much, if you were to seek them.</p>
  <p>A. Then don’t you think I would seek them?</p>
  <p>
    S. I do, if you <em>thought</em>
    <span class="hl" id="e4">you didn’t know them</span>.
  </p>
  <p>A. Then was there not a time when I was in that condition?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110a)</span>
  <p>
    S. Beautifully put. Are you able to tell me that time when you didn’t think
    you knew the just and the unjust things? Come on, did you seek and not think
    you knew last year? Or did you think you knew? And tell me the truth, so
    that our
    <span class="hl" id="e5">conversations</span> aren’t in vain.
  </p>
  <p>A. But I thought I knew.</p>
  <p>
    S. And two years ago and three and four, were you not in the same condition?
  </p>
  <p>A. I was.</p>
  <p>S. Moreover, before that you were a child&mdash;right?</p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>S. I know well that you thought you knew <em>then</em>.</p>
  <p>A. How do you know well?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110b)</span>
  <p>
    S. Often, when you were a child, at school and elsewhere, when you were
    playing dice or playing some other game, I heard you, not as if you were at
    a loss about the just and unjust things, but speaking loudly and boldly
    about whichever of the children you happened on that he was good-for-nothing
    and unjust, in other words, that he was doing you an injustice. Isn’t that
    right?
  </p>
  <p>A. But what was I going to do, Socrates, when someone did me injustice?</p>
  <p>
    S. Do you mean, what ought you to do if you were in fact at that time
    ignorant of whether he was doing you an injustice or not?"
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110c)</span>
  <p>
    A. No, by Zeus, I was not ignorant then, but I clearly recognized that I was
    being done an injustice!
  </p>
  <p>
    S.
    <span class="hl" id="e6"
      >Then you thought you knew the just and the unjust things, even when you
      were a child, it seems.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>A. I did, and I really did know.</p>
  <p>
    S. By having discovered them when? For I don’t suppose it was when you
    thought you knew.
  </p>
  <p>A. Clearly not.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then when did you believe you were ignorant? Think about it; you won’t
    discover that time.
  </p>
  <p>A. By Zeus, Socrates, I’m not able to say.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110d)</span>
  <p>S. So you don’t know them by having discovered them.</p>
  <p>A. It really doesn’t appear so.</p>
  <p>
    S. But yet you were <em>just</em> saying that you don’t know them by having
    learned them either. If you neither discovered it nor learned it, how and
    from where do you know it?
  </p>
  <p>
    A. But maybe I wasn’t right in saying that I myself knew it by having
    discovered it.
  </p>
  <p>
    S.
    <span class="hl" id="e7"
      >But what, as a matter of fact, <em>was</em> the situation?</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>A. I think I learned in the way that others also do.</p>
  <p>
    S. Once again, we’ve arrived at the same
    <span class="hl" id="e8">argument</span>. From whom? Tell me, too.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110e)</span>
  <p>A. From the many.</p>
  <p>
    S. In appealing to the many, you’re taking refuge with
    <span class="hl" id="e9">worthless</span>
    <span class="hl" id="e10">teachers</span>.
  </p>
  <p>A. How? Aren’t they capable of teaching?</p>
  <p>
    S. Not what things are and are not good to do in
    <span class="hl" id="e11">board games</span>, at any rate; and yet those, I
    think, are <span class="hl" id="e12">less important</span> than just ones.
    What&mdash;don’t you think that’s how it is?
  </p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>
    S.
    <span class="hl" id="e13"
      >Then they are not able to teach the less important things, but are able
      to teach those of greater worth</span
    >?
  </p>
  <p>
    A. <em>I</em> think so; but at any rate they are able to teach many things
    of more worth than board games.
  </p>
  <p>S. What sorts of things?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111a)</span>
  <p>
    A. For instance, I also learned
    <span class="hl" id="e14">Greek</span> from them, and I couldn’t name my
    teacher, but I appeal to those whom you say are worthless teachers.
  </p>
  <p>
    S. But, my noble friend, the many are good teachers of this, and they would
    justly be <span class="hl" id="e15">praised</span> for their teaching.
  </p>
  <p>A. Why?</p>
  <p>
    S. Because they possess, in this matter, the things which good teachers
    ought to possess.
  </p>
  <p>A. What are you talking about?</p>
  <p>
    S. Don’t you know that those who are going to teach anything first have to
    know it themselves? Or not?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111b)</span>
  <p>A. How could they not?</p>
  <p>S. And those who know agree with each other and don’t disagree?</p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>S. Do you say that they know those matters in which they disagree?</p>
  <p>A. Plainly not.</p>
  <p>S. How could they be teachers of these things?</p>
  <p>A. In no way.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111c)</span>
  <p>
    S. What, then? Do the many seem to you to disagree about
    <span class="hl" id="e16">what sorts of</span>
    <span class="hl" id="e17">things are sticks and stones?</span> And if you
    ask one of them, don’t they agree on the same things, and go after the same
    things when they want to get a stone or a stick? And it’s the same for all
    matters like this. I’m
    <span class="hl" id="e18">getting a pretty good idea</span> of what you mean
    by “knowing Greek,” right?
  </p>
  <p>A. You are.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then they agree with one another and with themselves on these points, as
    we said, in private, and in public cities are not at odds with one another,
    some saying these and others others?
  </p>
  <p>A. Of course not.</p>
  <p>S. So they’d likely be good teachers of at least these things.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111d)</span>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then if we should want to make someone know about them, we would
    correctly send them to the teaching of the famous “many”?
  </p>
  <p>A. Of course.</p>
  <p>
    S. But what if we should want to know, not only what sorts of things are
    people or horses, but also which of them are
    <span class="hl" id="e19">good at running and not</span>? Are the many still
    capable of teaching this?
  </p>
  <p>A. Clearly no!</p>
  <p>
    S. And is it sufficient proof that they do not know, nor are sterling
    teachers of them, since they in no way agree with themselves about them?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111e)</span>
  <p>A. For me it is.</p>
  <p>
    S. But what if we should want to know, not only what sorts of things are
    people, but what sorts are healthy or sick? Would the many be capable
    teachers for us?
  </p>
  <p>A. Plainly not.</p>
  <p>
    S. Would it be a proof for you that they are miserable teachers of these
    things, if you saw them disagreeing?
  </p>
  <p>A. For me it would.</p>
  <p>
    S. What, then? Do the many seem to you to agree with themselves or one
    another now, about just and unjust people and things?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112a)</span>
  <p>A. By Zeus, least of all, Socrates!</p>
  <p>
    S. What, then? Do they disagree about them
    <span class="hl" id="e20">most of all</span>?
  </p>
  <p>A. A whole lot.</p>
  <p>
    S. So I don’t <em>think</em> you’ve ever seen or heard people disagreeing so
    vehemently about things that are healthy and not as to fight and kill one
    another on their account.
  </p>
  <p>S. Clearly not.</p>
  <p>
    S. But I know that, about just and unjust things, even if you haven’t seen,
    you’ve at least heard many others and Homer; for you’ve heard the
    <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Iliad</em>.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112b)</span>
  <p>A. Obviously, Socrates.</p>
  <p>S. Then are these poems about disagreement on just and unjust things?</p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>
    S. And there were fights and even deaths for both the
    <span class="hl" id="e21">Achaeans</span> and the Trojans on account of this
    disagreement, and for the suitors of Penelope and for Odysseus.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112c)</span>
  <p>A. You speak the truth.</p>
  <p>
    S. And I think that for those of the
    <span class="hl" id="e22"
      >Athenians and Spartans and Boeotians who died at Tanagra, and for those
      who died later at Coroneia, among whom your father too met his end</span
    >, disagreement over nothing at all other than about the just and the unjust
    has produced the deaths and the battles, right?
  </p>
  <p>A. You speak the truth.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then are we to say that these people know about the things they disagree
    about so vehemently that in being at odds with each other they do the
    ultimate harm to themselves?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112d)</span>
  <p>A. Evidently not.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then are you appealing to such teachers whom you yourself agree do not
    know?
  </p>
  <p>A. So it seems.</p>
  <p>
    S. How, then, is it likely that you know the just and the unjust things,
    about which you wander in this way and evidently have not learned from
    anyone or discovered yourself?
  </p>
  <p>
    A. From what you’re saying,
    <span class="hl" id="e23">it’s not likely</span>.
