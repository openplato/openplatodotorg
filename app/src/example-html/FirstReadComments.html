    here that is central to Socrates’ project. In many of Plato’s dialogues,
    Socrates questions someone who should know something, given their social
    role (e.g., questioning a teacher of virtue about what virtue really is). It
    seems that Socrates does this in an attempt to show that, actually, the
    person does not have that knowledge. What’s the point? One answer might be
    to motivate the person to do some more thinking. If a person becomes aware
    that they are ignorant about something, especially something of importance,
    then (the hope is!) they will be motivated to try to figure it out.<br />Suppose
    that a teacher of virtue doesn’t really know what virtue is. In that case,
    they would be seriously misleading people. What might be useful, then, is to
    convince the teacher that actually they don’t know what virtue is, thus
    motivating them to spend some time discovering it before they return to
    teaching it.<br />But is this implicit thought true? Is it true that, in a
    slogan, awareness of ignorance motivates further inquiry? You might have
    your doubts. Someone ambitious for power and fame (like Alcibiades) might
    not care at all that they don’t really know what justice is. Who needs that?
    All that matters to them is appearing knowledgeable, not actually being
    knowledgeable. In that case, Socrates’ project would meet with a serious
    obstacle.

    <span class="tags">#firstread #philosophical</span><br />Socrates and
    Alcibiades seem to agree that a person will know something only if they were
    taught it or discovered it on their own. But there is at least one other
    possibility. Maybe we are born with knowledge. Maybe there is innate
    knowledge of some things. In fact, there is already some evidence in the
    dialogue that, when it comes to justice, people do have <em>some</em> sort
    of innate <em>sense</em> of it. Even as a boy, Alcibiades was certain that
    certain actions were unjust. More generally, children often perceive
    immediately when they have been treated unfairly. This is good evidence that
    people do have an innate <em>sense</em> of justice or fairness. You don’t
    really need to teach a child anything for that child to be able to perceive
    that they are being treated unfairly in some cases. However, it isn’t good
    evidence that people have innate <em>knowledge</em> of justice or fairness.
    If they did, then they wouldn’t ever misidentify when something is just or
    unjust.

    here, <em>tōn pollōn</em>, is often translated as “the many.” It can evoke
    an opposition between the common people (of whom there are many) and the
    elite (of whom there are not many). Other possibilities include “people in
    general,” “the people,” “the multitude,” “the masses,” or just “people.”

    ><br />Socrates and Alcibiades agree to this general principle: if a person
    is able to teach something, then they must have knowledge of it. True or
    false? Maybe it is true in some cases but not in other cases. It is hard to
    imagine that a person could teach someone the structure of a biological cell
    without having knowledge of it herself. Imagine, though, cases where
    observing someone’s behavior provides useful instruction in how to act well.
    It could be that role models provide useful examples of what, for example,
    dignity or integrity really is even in cases where the role models do not
    have knowledge these things. In fact, this is one way to think of Socrates’
    own sort of teaching. He claims to know nothing of any importance (<em
      >Apology</em
    >
    21b-23b), but Plato reports that he provided an example to many people of
    how to live well (<em>Phaedo</em> 118a).

    people disagree about the answer to 9583 divided by 7. Isn’t that enough to
    show that at least one of them does <em>not</em> know the right answer? If
    people disagree, then at least one of them does not know (of course, maybe
    all of them do not know). It seems that this principle is true for any case
    where there is a fact of the matter about the thing under dispute, that is,
    where there really is a right answer to it.

  <p id="fr-c6">
    <span class="tags">#firstread #philosophical #otherPlato</span><br />What’s
    translated here as “don’t waffle” is a word that, in the Greek, literally
    means to “agree with oneself”. What does it mean to agree with oneself? If
    this is to make any sense, then there must be at least two parts to a
    person: the part that makes the claim, and the part that agrees with it.
    This might sound odd at first, but probably you can remember a time in your
    life when one part of you (how else to say it?) thought that something was
    true (for example, thought that something was best for you to do), but
    another part of you had a different idea altogether. These are moments of
    internal conflict, tension, or disharmony, and, to many people, they are
    regrettably familiar. The opposite is when you do agree with
    yourself—moments of internal peace, relaxation, or harmony.<br />But what
    really are these parts anyway? Are there really multiple parts to a person’s
    mind or soul, similar to how there are multiple parts to a person’s body? Or
    is that just a metaphorical way of talking?<br />Plato has a lot to say
    about this. The best place to start is book 4 of the <em>Republic</em>,
    where Socrates argues that, for each of us, there are three parts to our
    mind or soul: an appetitive part, a rational part, and a spirited part.

    <span class="tags">#firstread #philosophical</span><br />Socrates observes
    that everyone agrees about what counts as a stick and what counts as a
    stone. He then infers that people in general would be good teachers of what
    a stone or stick is, more specifically, that people <em>likely</em> would be
    good teachers of this. Here, as often in philosophy, one word really
    matters. It doesn’t follow, of course, that people would be good teachers of
    something from the mere fact that they happen to agree about it. They might
    all be wrong! But it is more plausible that, if they do all agree about
    something, then they would likely be good teachers of it. After all, it is
    unlikely that so many people would be wrong about something they all agree
    upon. But it is not impossible.

    <em>Odyssey</em> are epic poems composed by Homer in what would have already
    been considered the ancient past in Plato’s time. They were standard reading
    for the education of Athenian elites and were commonly recited in public,
    including at the Panathenaic festival.

    of the suitors of Penelope, wife of Odysseus, plays a recurring role in the
    Odyssey. The suitors pursue Penelope despite her disinterest, taunt her son
    Telemachus, and even harass Odysseus himself after he returns from the
    Trojan War. Odysseus and Telemachus then ruthlessly slaughter all of the
    suitors.

    <span class="tags">#firstread #philosophical</span><br />Alcibiades admits
    that he probably does not know what’s just and unjust. Could we apply the
    same form of argument to other topics, to show that Alcibiades also doesn’t
    know about them? It seems that the argument should apply to anything we pick
    up from the people around us in childhood but about which there turns out to
    be disagreement within or between communities. Many of the most important
    things in our lives are like that. Here’s a different kind of example from
    the one given in the text: the meaning of identity categories (e.g., how a
    “real” man or woman behaves). What else do you think the argument might
    apply to?
