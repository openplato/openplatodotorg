  <p>
    S. Then by calling something “better” in the context of deciding when to go
    to war and with whom, doesn’t “better” mean “more just”?
  </p>
  <p>A. Seems so.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(109d)</span>
  <p>
    S. How is that possible, dear Alcibiades? Which is it: are you in denial
    about not knowing this, or have you been sneaking off with some teacher
    who’s taught you to distinguish the just from the unjust? And who is this
    teacher? Tell me, and introduce me as another follower.
  </p>
  <p>A. Now you’re just teasing me, Socrates.</p>
  <p>S. I swear on our friendship, I’m not! Tell me, if you really can.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(109e)</span>
  <p>
    A. And what if I can’t? Couldn’t I know what’s just or unjust some other
    way?
  </p>
  <p>S. Sure&mdash;if you had discovered it yourself.</p>
  <p>A. You don’t believe I could have discovered it?</p>
  <p>S. Certainly&mdash;if you were looking for it.</p>
  <p>A. And you don’t think I would have looked for it?</p>
  <p>
    S. I do&mdash;if you thought
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e1">you didn’t know.</span>
  </p>
  <p>A. And wasn’t there a time when that would have been the case?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110a)</span>
  <p>
    S. Well said. So tell me, when was it that you didn’t think you knew what’s
    just or unjust? Could it have been last year? Or did you think you did know?
    Be honest so that these conversations aren’t a waste of our time.
  </p>
  <p>A. I thought I knew...</p>
  <p>
    S. What about two, three, and four years ago? Did you think you knew then
    too?
  </p>
  <p>A. I did.</p>
  <p>S. And before that you were a kid, right?</p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>S. Well, I’m confident you thought you knew then.</p>
  <p>A. What makes you so sure?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110b)</span>
  <p>
    S. When you were a child playing dice or other games, I often heard you
    tattling on whoever happened to be there&mdash;that so-and-so was bad and
    had cheated, already so sure about what was just and unjust. Isn’t that
    right?
  </p>
  <p>A. What else could I do, Socrates, after being cheated?</p>
  <p>S. Are you asking what you should do when you don’t know?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110c)</span>
  <p>A. No! I did know. I was clearly being cheated.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then you thought you understood what was just and unjust, even at that
    young age.
  </p>
  <p>A. And I really did understand.</p>
  <p>
    S. Okay then, and you discovered it when? Clearly not when you thought you
    knew.
  </p>
  <p>A. Of course not</p>
  <p>
    S. Then try and “discover” a time when you didn’t know. You won’t come up
    with one.
  </p>
  <p>A. Well shoot, Socrates. I guess I really can’t.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110d)</span>
  <p>S. So you don’t know it from having discovered it.</p>
  <p>A. I guess that seems to be the case.</p>
  <p>
    S. But didn’t you also just say that you don’t know from having learned it?
    If you didn’t discover it and you didn’t learn it, how do you know?
  </p>
  <p>A. Well, maybe I was wrong to say I discovered it myself.</p>
  <p>S. Then how did it happen?</p>
  <p>A. I probably learned it the way everyone does.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then let me ask you again.
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e2">Who taught you?</span>
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(110e)</span>
  <p>A. <span class="hl" id="fr-e3">Society</span>.</p>
  <p>S. You’re not relying on very serious teachers then.</p>
  <p>A. What&mdash;you don’t think these people can teach?</p>
  <p>
    S. They can’t even teach you how to play a board game well. And you think
    they can teach you about what’s just and unjust? What&mdash;isn’t that
    right?
  </p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>
    S. So they can’t teach trivial things, but <em>only</em> the more serious
    stuff?
  </p>
  <p>
    A. Sure. Anyway, <em>I</em> like to think there are many serious things
    these people can teach.
  </p>
  <p>S. Like what?</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111a)</span>
  <p>
    A. Well, for one, I did learn how to <em>be</em> Greek from them. I can’t
    name a teacher, I just rely on those you accuse of not being serious.
  </p>
  <p>
    S. But, good sir, society <em>is</em> a good teacher of this, and it would
    be right to praise its teaching.
  </p>
  <p>A. What?</p>
  <p>S. In this instance, they have what it takes to be good teachers.</p>
  <p>A. What do you mean?</p>
  <p>
    S.
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e4"
      >You know you have to know something before teaching it, right?</span
    >
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111b)</span>
  <p>A. Obviously.</p>
  <p>
    S. So there won’t be any disputes? The ones who know will all agree with
    each other?
  </p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>S. Would you say they know the things they disagree about?</p>
  <p>A. <span class="hl" id="fr-e5">Of course not</span>.</p>
  <p>S. So if they disagree about something, could they teach it?</p>
  <p>A. No way.</p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111c)</span>
  <p>
    S. Well then, does it seem to you that society disagrees about what’s a
    stick and what’s a stone? That is, will they not give the same answers when
    asked, and go after the same things when they want to grab a stick or a
    stone? The same goes for all these kinds of things; maybe I’m catching on to
    what you mean by “knowing how to be Greek”?
  </p>
  <p>A. You are.</p>
  <p>
    S. So, as we said, individuals agree with one another and don’t
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e6">waffle</span> on these things? And disputes
    don’t arise between cities?
  </p>
  <p>A. Of course not.</p>
  <p>
    S.
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e7"
      >Then you would expect them to be good teachers of these things, at
      least</span
    >.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111d)</span>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>
    S. Then would we be right to direct someone to society’s teachings if we
    wanted them to know about those things?
  </p>
  <p>A. Absolutely.</p>
  <p>
    S. But what if we want to know more than what sorts of things are people or
    horses? Can society teach us which horses and which people are fastest?
  </p>
  <p>A. Obviously not.</p>
  <p>
    S. Since society can’t agree on these matters, isn’t that a good enough
    indication that it doesn’t know the answer and cannot illuminate these
    things for us?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(111e)</span>
  <p>A. Sure, for me it is.</p>
  <p>
    S. And could we count on society to teach us who’s sickly and who’s healthy?
  </p>
  <p>A. Obviously not.</p>
  <p>
    S. And again, if you saw them disagreeing, wouldn’t this prove that they’re
    terrible teachers of this sort of thing?
  </p>
  <p>A. It would for me.</p>
  <p>
    S. So — are you telling me society also agrees about who or what is just or
    unjust?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112a)</span>
  <p>A. That’s the last thing they’d agree on!</p>
  <p>S. So you’re telling me it’s their biggest disagreement?</p>
  <p>A. By a long shot.</p>
  <p>
    S. I bet you’ve never seen or heard of people coming to blows over what’s
    healthy or not.
  </p>
  <p>A. Of course not.</p>
  <p>
    S. But I know you’ve at least <em>heard</em> lots of folks disagreeing about
    what’s just and unjust. You’ve of course listened to Homer’s
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e8"><em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Iliad</em></span
    >.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112b)</span>
  <p>A. Who hasn’t, Socrates?</p>
  <p>
    S. Well, aren’t those poems about a conflict over what’s just and unjust?
  </p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>
    S. And the Greeks and Trojans fought and killed over this disagreement, as
    did
    <span class="hl" id="fr-e9">Odysseus and Penelope’s suitors</span>.
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112c)</span>
  <p>A. True.</p>
  <p>
    S. Wasn’t it a disagreement over what’s just and unjust that led to all
    those Athenians and Spartans and Boeotians dying at the battle of Tanagra,
    and later at Coroneia, including your father?
  </p>
  <p>A. True.</p>
  <p>
    S. So when they really disagree, to the point that they’re willing to risk
    the greatest harm, should we still say they know?
  </p>
  <span class="stephanus">(112d)</span>
  <p>A. Probably not.</p>
  <p>S. Then you are relying on teachers who you agree do not know.</p>
  <p>A. So it seems.</p>
  <p>
    S. How likely is it that you know what’s just and unjust when you’ve gone
    back and forth on this? It’s clear you haven’t learned from anyone or
    discovered it yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    A. <span class="hl" id="fr-e10">Not likely</span> based on what you’re
    saying.
