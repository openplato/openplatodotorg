The commentary content is representative of the types of commentary we will be producing during the grant period, though we will create more layers of interdisciplinary commentary and curate a first-read experience that can be viewed on its own in future phases of the project. We will also use a new method to generate content for our edition: a series of collaborative, content-generation workshops with content then edited by our editorial team.

        <note>Socrates will often insist that those who really know something also know what it is they know—and that it is better to be ignorant but mindful of one's ignorance (to "know that one knows nothing") than to know something yet fail to recognize the limits of one's knowledge. See Apology 21b-23b and 29b for an expression this view.</note>

        <note>For Socrates, the recognition of one's ignorance is a key step in our learning. A nice illustration of this point can be found in the slave lesson presented in the Meno (82a- 86c; see especially 84a-b).</note>

        <note>#firstread #philosophical</note>
        <note/>
        <note>What is implicit here is a thought that is central to Socrates’project. In many of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates questions someone who should know something, given their social role (e.g., a teacher of virtue about what virtue really is), and seemingly in an attempt to show that, actually, the person does not know it. What’s the point? One answer might be to motivate the person to do some more thinking. The thought is that, if a person becomes aware that they are ignorant about something, especially something of importance, then they will be motivated to try to figure it out. Suppose that a teacher of virtue doesn’t really know what virtue is. They would then be seriously misleading people. What might be needed is to convince the teacher that actually they don’t know what virtue is, thus motivating them to spend some time discovering it before they return to teaching it.</note>
        <note>But is this implicit thought true? Is it true that, in a slogan, awareness of ignorance motivates further inquiry? You might have your doubts. Someone ambitious for power and fame (someone like Alcibiades) might not care at all that they don’t really know what justice is. Who needs that? All they might care about is being able to appear knowledgeable, not actually being knowledgeable. In that case, Socrates’project would meet a serious obstacle.</note>

        <note>One might wonder how well the view suggested here would cohere with Socrates' self-presentation in other dialogues. In the Apology, for instance, we find a Socrates with strong convictions about what is just and unjust—a Socrates who claims to know that it is unjust to disobey one's moral superior (29b), and who is prepared to risk his life to disobey a tyrant's order he takes to be unjust (32b). Can Socrates profess ignorance about matters of justice and nonetheless express and act on convictions of this sort?</note>
        <note/>
        <note>One possible response requires our distinguishing knowledge of what makes things just, and explains the justice of any just actions, from knowledge of particular instances of justice (obeying your moral superior is just, cheating at dice is unjust, and so on). The first kind of knowledge  amounts to a kind of expertise about some subject, while the second is everyday knowledge (so that you might, for instance, know that eating loads of sugar is bad for you, even if you don't have the expertise to fully explain why). Socrates might thus think he is ignorant when it comes to this first kind of knowledge, since he is not an expert about justice, even while taking himself have the second, everyday kind of knowledge. But the distinction doesn't seem to be on Alcibiades' radar here.</note>

        <note>Socrates and Alcibiades seem to agree that a person will know something only if they were taught it or discovered it on their own. But there is at least one other possibility. Maybe a person can be born with knowledge. Maybe there is innate knowledge of some things. In fact, there is already some evidence in the dialogue that, when it comes to justice, people do have some sort of innate knowledge. Even as a boy, Alcibiades was certain that certain actions were unjust. More generally, children often perceive immediately when they have been treated unfairly–or at least when they seem to have been treated unfairly. This is good evidence that people do have an innate sense of justice or fairness. You don’t really need to teach a child anything for that child to protest that they are being treated unfairly. But it isn’t good evidence that people have innate knowledge of justice or fairness. If they did, then they wouldn’t ever get it wrong.</note>

There are questions about what kind of worth this might be, especially when it is applied not only to teachers, but also to the things they teach.

        <note>How defensible is this principle? If to be "worthier" is to be more difficult, the principle might seem attractive: if someone can't teach something less difficult, why think they can teach something more difficult? But this version of the principle is open to an objection. Someone may be unable to teach something less difficult simply because it doesn't matter enough for them to have invested the time in understanding it, and able to teach something more difficult because it matters enough to deserve their attention. The very examples in the text, board games and justice, support this line of objection: we might explain the many's inability to teach skill at board games by pointing to the insignificance of board games, not the cognitive deficiencies of the many. A similar objection will arise if we formulate the principle in terms of the value of the pursuit: we cannot infer that if someone cannot teach something less valuable, they cannot teach something more valuable, for the same reasons.</note>

        <note>Socrates and Alcibiades agree to this general principle: if a person is able to teach something, then they must have knowledge of it. True or false? Maybe it is true in some cases but not in other cases. It is hard to imagine that a person could teach someone the structure of a biological cell without having knowledge of it herself. Imagine, though, cases where observing someone’s behavior provides useful instruction in how to act well or how to think well (or how not to act or think). It could be that a role model doesn’t really need to have knowledge of what, for example, integrity or dignity really is to provide an example that teaches it to others. In fact, this is one way to think of Socrates’sort of teaching. He claims to know nothing of any importance (Apology 21b-23b), but Plato reports him to have provided an example to many of how best to live (Phaedo 118a).</note>

        <note>Imagine that two people disagree about the answer to 9583 divided by 7. Isn’t that enough to show that at least one of them does not know the right answer? If people disagree, then at least one of them does not know (of course, maybe all of them do not know). It seems that this principle is true for any case where there is a fact of the matter about the thing under dispute, that is, whether there really is a right answer to it, one that holds for everyone.</note>

        <note>To know what sorts of things are sticks and stones is just to know some of the qualities of these things (e.g. sticks come from trees, stones can break glass, etc), where this is distinct from knowing what the thing is (the definition of the thing in question). It might seem possible to know the qualities of certain things without knowing the definition of the thing whose qualities one knows, especially if the standard for a definition is high (as it is for the Socrates Plato presents in his dialogues—see Euthyphro 10a-11b). In the Meno, however, Plato has Socrates and his interlocutor agree to an important principle: you cannot know what sort of thing something is if you don't know what the thing is (71b). This invites the question later raised by Meno (80d5-7): how is learning possible, if one begins without knowing what something is, and one can't even know what sort of thing something is without knowing what it is?</note>

        <note>#translation #philosophical</note>
        <note/>
        <note>Denyer (p. 123) suggests translating "which things are sticks or stones" (see LSJ IV), noting that poion ("what sort" might be used in place of ti "what", to avoid confusion with the famous Socratic "what is it?" questions, which seek a definition. However, poion often asks after a thing's qualities, and so the translation aims to preserve this possibility. At the same time, it does not demand it, insofar as "what sorts of things" might also be asking for an identification of some things and not an account of their qualities.</note>

        <note>What does it mean to agree with oneself? If this is to make any sense, then there must be at least two parts to a person: the part that makes the claim, and the part that agrees to it. This might sound odd at first, but probably you can remember a time in your life when one part of you (how else to say it?) thought that something was true, for example, thought that this would be best for you overall, but another part of you had a different idea altogether. These are moments of internal conflict, tension, or disharmony, and, to many people, they are regrettably familiar. The opposite is when you do agree with yourself—moments of internal peace, relaxation, or harmony.</note>
        <note/>
        <note>But what really are these parts anyway? Are there really multiple parts to a person’s mind or soul, similar to how there are multiple parts to a person’s body, or is that just a metaphorical way of talking?</note>
        <note>Plato has a lot to say about this. The best place to start is book 4 of the Republic, where Socrates argues that, for each of us, there are three parts to our mind or soul: an appetitive part, a rational part, and a spirited part.</note>

        <note>Socrates infers that people in general would be good teachers of what wood or stone is from the observation that everyone agrees about what counts as wood or as stone—that people likely would be good teachers. Here, as often in philosophy, one word really matters. It doesn’t follow, of course, that people would be good teachers of something from the mere fact that they happen to agree about it. They might all be wrong! But it is more plausible that, if they do all agree about it, then likely they would be good teachers of it. After all, it is unlikely that so many people would be wrong about something they all agree upon. But it is not impossible.</note>

In 457 BCE the Athenians were defeated by the Spartans and Boeotians at Tanagra, but then the Athenians returned and captured Tanagra a few months later. The battle of Coroneia (also spelled Coronea) took place ten years later in 447 and was a significant Athenian defeat.</note>

        <note>The argument in the text distinguishes between cases in which there is no actual disagreement between communities (e.g. the rules of the Greek language) and cases in which there is actual disagreement between communities (e.g. the nature of justice and injustice). But is actual disagreement about topic T necessary to make us doubt that the many know about T? We might think that the fact that the many present themselves as teachers of (say) justice even though they are not good teachers of justice should make us doubt their reliability in general, not just when there is disagreement. Or we might think something even more radical: that the fact that a source of knowledge that we have always trusted —our immediate communities—turned out to be unreliable should make us worried about other previously secure seeming avenues of knowledge.</note>
        <note/>
        <note>al-Ghazali's The Rescuer from Error, later in the philosophical tradition, takes up this last idea. It begins with the observation that what religious tradition we are raised in as children determines the religious tradition we adhere to as adults; but instead of restricting himself to the problem of disagreements in "conformist" beliefs, al-Ghazali uses this as motivation to examine other belief-forming mechanisms that he had previously considered secure, like perception.</note>

        <note>Alcibiades here admits that he probably does not know about the just and the unjust. Could we apply the argument to other topics, to show that Alcibiades probably doesn't know about them, either? It seems like the argument should apply to anything we pick up from the people around us in childhood but about which there turns out to be disagreement within or between communities. Many of the most important things in our lives are like that. Here's a different kind of example from the one given in the text: the meaning of identity categories (e.g., how a 'real' man or woman behaves). What else do you think the argument might apply to?</note>
